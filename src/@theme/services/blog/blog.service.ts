			'<p>Intellectual property may be a kind of protection that offers the originator/owner the chance to bring action below civil law to prevent others to use work that some have created, using, marketing their own creation. In short, it provides the suggestions that to prosecute holding thieves, works showing intelligence with different creatives and organizations, and allows you to access the money you earned for your artistic efforts:</p><figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="assets/img/blog/prop.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-42" width="481" height="268"/></figure><p><strong>Patents </strong>- the patent grants the inventor exclusivity on the use of the invention in the State where it has been applied for. Products, devices, processes, foodstuffs or substances can be patented. There are criteria for being able to patent a product, or process or other, which must be:</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>New</p><p>Creative</p><p>Tradeable</p><p>permitted</p></blockquote><p><strong>Design </strong>â€“ used to protect the visual appearance of a product. This can also be registered under patents, but for better protection this must be registered with the IPO (Intellectual Property Office).</p><p><strong>Trademark </strong>- protect new or existing brands. There are two very different points of view when it comes to defining a brand: advertising and legal.</p><p>In the world of communication, the brand is often used as asynonym for the logo, meaning one of the elements that make up the brandidentity and which, in the common language, is often identified as the"graphic part" of the brand (for example the Apple or the crocodileof Lacoste).</p><p><strong>Copyright </strong>- protects art, books, websites, photographs, music, etc... In many countries, when a person creates an original work embedded in a physical medium, he or she automatically owns the copyright. As the copyright holder, the person has the exclusive right to use that work. In most cases, only the copyright holder can indicate if someone else is authorized to use his work.</p><h4>Differencesbetween patent protection and copyright</h4><p>Copyright does not protect the idea but only its expression.The expression of software lies in its code. Therefore, it is the source codeand the object code that are protected by copyright, but not their function.This means that anyone can make software with a function like the one Icreated, as long as they do so without copying the source code and the objectcode.</p><p>Let s say, for example, that I was the first to create aprogram that allows you to free up space on your hard disk by deleting uselessfiles.Anyone can use my idea and create a similar and alternative program, aslong as it gets there by writing its own source code and does not copy mine.< /p><p>Often, for a developer it is not difficult to modify asource code just enough to exclude the copy, while obtaining the same function.For this reason, software houses tend not to detect the source codes of theirprograms. However, this caution is not always enough. The risk is that of"reverse engineering". In fact, through decompilation programs, it ispossible to go back from the obect code to the source code (with greater orlesser precision).</p > <p>The protection guaranteed by the patent is more intense thanthat guaranteed by copyright.In fact, the patent allows the invention to beprotected in any form it is reproduced: both literally and for equivalents.< /p><p>It is true that the duration of the protection guaranteed bycopyright is longer than the patent (70 years from the death of the authorinstead of 20 years from the patent application). However, this is irrelevantfor software, which becomes obsolete after a few years.</p > <p>On the other hand, copyright protection arises automaticallywith the creation of the work, while the patent requires registration.< /p><h4>Conclusion</h4 > <p>The intellectual property of software is always protected bycopyright.The exclusive rights of the author are created automatically, without the need for any formality.However, you can register the software inthe<a href = "https://www.copyrightservice.co.uk/">UK Copyright service</ a >, inorder to obtain a certain proof of authorship.< /p><p>It is of vital importance to regulate copyright in everysoftware contract: software license agreements, software developmentagreements, etc.</p > <p>Finally, for software that has an additional technicaleffect, the possibility of obtaining a patent should be considered.In fact, this form of protection is very intense and guarantees a monopoly on theinvention for 20 years.Distinguishing between patentable and non - patentable softwareis often complicated and requires a case -by -case assessment by an expert.</p>',

The clearest way in which Networking helps you build your career is that recruiters or companies they want to hire look first at their Network when hiring or looking for web developers, in fact research reveals that 85% off all jobs are filled via Networking &nbsp;(reference: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-survey-reveals-85-all-jobs-filled-via-networking-lou-adler/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-survey-reveals-85-all-jobs-filled-via-networking-lou-adler/</a>) , employee references and networking are two of the best ways in which companies report their candidates to fill open positions.</p><figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="assets/img/blog/RGBC-00056_2015-09-02_v01_Why-Networking-Important-graphic.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-71" width="482" height="252"/></figure><p>One of the largest social media to build a Networking, isLinkedIn. LinkedIn is the ideal place to do much of the networking work of alltypes of networks. As a social media&nbsp;stage&nbsp;for&nbsp;experts,LinkedIn&nbsp;makes a difference&nbsp;you keep up with everything you&nbsp;arrange&nbsp;isdoingand&nbsp;gives&nbsp;a&nbsp;gathering&nbsp;to&nbsp;examine&nbsp;vital&nbsp;business&nbsp;thoughts&nbsp;and&nbsp;create&nbsp;professionallyby learning things&nbsp;past&nbsp;your&nbsp;normal&nbsp;part. LinkedIn is nolonger just an online CV site; you get out of it what you put into it.</p><h5>The importance of neworking by USQ Edu</h5><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">https://youtu.be/Zi3QGjEcQNU</div></figure><h5>Meet-ups andEvents</h5><p>Networking events are an incredible place. At these eventsyou can have the opportunity to talk with different companies. This allows youto talk about current projects, new themes and thoughts with other people. Oneof the sites to attend events is meetup.com. This site is a thematic site, youcan join groups that have the same interest and knowledge as you, and it allowsyou to attend meetings and talk about what you are interested in and learn newthings. The application will tell you when a meeting will take place, generallynearby you. When you go to these events it is ideal for bringing businesscards. This way you stand out from potential managers and contributors.</p><h4>How tobecome an effective networker</h4><p>The&nbsp;significance&nbsp;of&nbsp;organizing&nbsp;cannotbe&nbsp;intemperate.&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, how can you&nbsp;progress&nbsp;your&nbsp;organizing&nbsp;aptitudes&nbsp;to&nbsp;guarantee&nbsp;acompetent and&nbsp;fruitful&nbsp;organized&nbsp;association?</p><h5>Figure outwhat style is best for you on networking.</h5><p>There is no way to be the same for everyone when you are online. You can be successful utilizing distinctive organize strategies. Try touse different strategies to find out which one is best for you. Example try toattend more intimate events to start where there are not many participants,once you have discovered which is your ideal networking style, consider whereyou can go to meet and meet the right people who could help you achieve yourgoals and develop your professional career.</p><h5>Follow Up </h5><p>This is a simple task, but many disregards this stage of the networking process. Time spent talking to new people will not benefit your professional development if you fail your next path. When you have followed someone to an event or met them at a meeting, although you do not need to send a long and heard message, but you should send a connection request to LinkedIn with a personalized message. </p>',
